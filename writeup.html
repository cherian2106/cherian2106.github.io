  <h1 > Q: What plays a bigger role in the success of a Soccer team, offense or defense?</h1>
  </div>
  <div class = "cont">
<br>There are two popular sayings that are thrown around in football: "Offense is the best form of defense" and "Attack wins matches, defense win trophies".
This made me wonder which of these actually play a bigger role in the success of a team.
For this reason I have attempted to compare the attack and defense of the teams in the English premier league over the last 26 years. I have made an interactive slideshow which
eventually leads to a page from where you have three options to view three different bar charts that compare different
stats of the current top 6 teams over the last 2 years. This allows people to compare the teams over a large number of years, as well as see what the result is in recent years. Thus
the <u>NARRATIVE STRUCTURE</u> of my project can be thought of as a martini glass since it starts with a slideshow after which the user has multiple options
as to where they want to go.</br>
<br>In each slide you can move to the next or the previous slide using buttons on the page. These are the <u>TRIGGERS</u>
in my project since it shifts the slide </br>
<br>The slide show starts with 4 scatterplots. All of these scatter plots gives you the option to hover over the circles
to give you the exact details of each data point. Each circle is colored a different color to represent the different teams.
There is a legend which shows what color corresponds to what team. Further, you can click on any rectangle on the legend
to highlight the datapoint it corresponds to. This is the <u>ANNOTATION</u> in the slide since it highlights the corresponding datapoint and legend block
and draws the users attention to the data point I want.</br>
<br>The first scatterplot is a comparison between Points per game and Goals scored per game by every team. Since both data values are Independent, Continuous and
Quantitative, I used a scatterplot. The Axes are linear and start from 0.6 so that the points are spread out evenly. The radius of the circles correspond to the number
of trophies won by the team. The correlation between the two variables are written on the page to help the user understand the plot better and to help
make decisions. This can also be thought of as an <u>ANNOTATION</u> since it brings the users attention to a
an important point which helps them make a decision.
The second scatterplot is similar to the first but compares the points per game to 1/Goals conceded per game. This is done
to have a scatterplot with a positive slope to make it easier to compare the two plots.
The third and fourth scatterplot compares the success of a team to the Goals scored and 1/goals condeded per game.
Success is defined as (Titles won*4 + Second place*3 + Third Place*2 + Fourth*1). The Y axis has a Log scale so that the data is spread out evenly.</br>
<br>After the scatterplots we reach a page where you have the option to view either Points gained by the top 6 teams in the last two years, Goals Scored
by the top 6 teams in the last 2 years or the Goals conceded by the top 6 in the last 2 years. This allows people to see what the trend is in recent years
and see if it is different than from the last 26 years' data. The X - axis of the bar charts contain nominal data of the top 6 clubs and so the appropriate axis was chosen.
The bar charts have text at the bottom which a user can double click to show the data for the other year, ie, either data for 2017-2018 or data for 2016-2017.
This is the <u>PARAMETER</u> part of my project since pressing it changes the data that is displayed for the user to see.</br>
<br>To summarize the rubric, The hybrid <u>NARRATIVE STRUCTURE</u> that my visualisation follows is
that of a martini glass since it starts with a slide show followed by the ability to move to multiple scenes
from a single page. There are multiple <u>SCENES</u> in my visualisation which starts with 4 scatter plots followed by
three bar charts. There are buttons to move from one scene to another which act as the <u>TRIGGERS</u> for the visualisation.
The buttons look 3D so that the user can know that he can click them to move to that slide number.
The scatterplots allow you to highlight data points by clicking on the legend as well display information on hovering over the
points. These act as <u>ANNOTATIONS</u> since they highlight information and draws the users attention to information
that helps them make decisions. The bar charts contain text at the bottom of the page which can be <b>double-clicked</b> to view data from a different year. This acts as
the <u>PARAMETERS</u> for my visualisation since it changes the data displayed for the user to view and make a decision.</br>
